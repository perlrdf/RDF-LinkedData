RDF-LinkedData
--------------

This is an alpha release of a server framework for serving RDF Linked Data.
It follows the basic best practice recommendations with 303 redirects
from the URIs that point to the physical or abstract things to
documents that describe them. There are some open issues, especially
with content negotation, not all content types are supported and it
may not quite do the right thing if the desired the content type is
not found.

The distribution contains a script called linked_data.psgi. This sets
up a basic Web server based on Plack, which is a modern
high-performance framework. Running this script with the plackup
utility will give you a web server with all the features of this
module.

Currently, RDF::LinkedData contains several methods that superclass
may inherit to provide their own functionality. It is not quite clear
yet if this is the Right Way to do it, so the API of this module may
change.
